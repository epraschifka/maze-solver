# maze_solver

# this is a maze solver which will find a valid solution to any maze drawn by the user on the 25x40 grid provided, if such a solution exists.

# to start the maze solver, click on the Code tab and then on "Download ZIP". Open the ZIP and save the "maze-solver-main" folder in a directory of your choice. In VSCode,
open the "maze-solver-main" folder. Right-click on the "maze_project.html" file, and click "Open with Live Server". The maze solver should then open in your preferred
browser. 

# click on individual squares, or drag your mouse across multiple squares, to draw a maze. You can then press "solve" to solve the maze you have drawn, or
"reset" to revert back to an empty maze.
